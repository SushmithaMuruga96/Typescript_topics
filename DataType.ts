let userName: string = "sushmitha";
console.log(userName.toUpperCase());

let fullName = "sushmitha Muruganantham";
//this is also correct where typescript doesnot expect to add type
//it will understand the type from the value and act accordingly

let userId: number = 123456.7;
console.log(userId);

let isloggedIn = true; //boolean

export {};
